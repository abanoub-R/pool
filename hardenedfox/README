NOTE  - the user/user-overrides.js files as well as updater.sh are not mine, 
        they come from the arkenfox/user.js repository, see it here:
        
        https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js

        the profile included in profile.zip is a slightly tweaked version
        from ffprofile.com, the profile is made with some quality-of-life
        features, but they may be overridden by the settings in user.js.
        to change these settings, edit user-overrides.js to your liking,
        then run updater.sh which will add your changes safely to user.js 
        and download the newest copy of the user.js file
        
        the user-overrides.js file also includes extra freatures to make
        firefox more usable.
       
USAGE - make a new profile through about:profiles. when done, close firefox
        and extract profile.zip into the root directory of your new profile
        which will typically be:
        
        ~/.mozilla/firefox/*.<NAME OF YOUR PROFILE>
        
        then move user.js and user-overrides.js into that root directory,
        and run updater.sh to refresh user.js since the overrides should
        be already applied.
