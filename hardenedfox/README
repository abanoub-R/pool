NOTE  - this profile was NOT built with enterprise policy features in mind.

        this profile was NOT built with support for non-linux OSes in mind.

        the user/user-overrides.js files as well as updater.sh are not mine, 
        they come from the arkenfox/user.js repository, see it here:
        
        https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js
        
        the profile included in profile.zip is a slightly tweaked version
        from ffprofile.com, the profile is made with some quality-of-life
        features, but they may be overridden by the settings in user.js.
        to change these settings, edit user-overrides.js to your liking,
        then run updater.sh which will add your changes safely to user.js 
        and download the newest copy of the user.js file
        
        the user-overrides.js file also includes extra freatures to make
        firefox more usable.
        
        the userChrome.css is copied from:
        
        https://github.com/pellaeon/firefox-91plus-photon-userchrome
        https://www.userchrome.org/firefox-89-styling-proton-ui.html#tabstyler
        
USAGE - this assumes you want to make a new profile, to override
        
        !!!      BEFORE GOING ANY FURTHER, CLOSE FIREFOX      !!!  
        
        to make a new profile through about:profiles, click on the
        "Create a new profile" button, and it'll walk you through
        the wizard.
        
        to create a profile through the terminal, run:
        
        firefox -no-remote -ProfileManager
        
        and extract profile.zip into the root directory of your new profile
        which will typically be:
        
        ~/.mozilla/firefox/*.<NAME OF YOUR PROFILE>
        
        then move user.js and user-overrides.js into that root directory,
        and run updater.sh to refresh user.js since the overrides should
        be already applied.
        
        to just use the addons, extract the addons.zip file to the root
        profile directory. when using addons.zip only, note the following
        from the ffprofile website:
        
        "When you download only the addons.zip, you need to copy the 
        user_pref("extensions.autoDisableScopes", 14); line into your 
        prefs.js, otherwise firefox won't install the addons."
        
        if you would like to restore the Photon UI, make a sub directory
        in your profile called "chrome" and move the "userChrome.css" into
        that sub directory.
        
        ( note that i have 0 experience with CSS so the code is a little sloppy. )
        ( i also didn't write it either, see the NOTE section above.             )
